# Safe Travel Infos
A visual representation of your ship distance from the warp tunnel between two planets. Fly safe!
It also shows the distance traveled in the danger zone when going straight to the destination.
The danger zone, represented as a red area here, is simply the tube around the warp line. Its ray is the range of the space radar: 2su.
You can select the origin planet on left, and the destination planet on right.
Keep in mind that the height (the distance from the warp line) has not the same scale as the width (the travel route), meaning that angles between them might not represent reality.
